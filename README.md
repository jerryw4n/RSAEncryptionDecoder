# RSAEncryptionDecoder
This Python script performs RSA decryption by factoring the modulus n to find its prime factors p and q, calculating Euler's Totient function, and deriving the private key d using the modular inverse of the public exponent e. It decrypts ciphertext blocks and converts them into plaintext.
